    "\n",
    " Conda is an open-source _package management system_ and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is used to install, run, and update packages and their dependencies which means that it allows you to 'compartmentalize' your projects and have multiple different working environments for different applications or workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Mamba is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++, which makes it faster and more efficient. Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R and other scientific computing and data science tools as well as many other useful packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " For all intents and purposes, you can consider conda, mamba, and anaconda to be interchangeable in the context of this course."

    " ## Why conda?\n",
    "\n",
    " Conda is widely used in the scientific computing and data science communities because it simplifies package management and deployment. It allows users to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring that dependencies do not conflict with each other. This is particularly useful in fields like genomics and bioinformatics, where different projects may require different versions of libraries and tools."
