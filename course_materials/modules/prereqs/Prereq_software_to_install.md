# Required software
Prior to the first day of class, please attempt to install the following software on your personal computers.  This will be the primary software tools used throughout the course.

### VScode
We will be using VScode as our primary code editor throughout the course. This is where we will write, edit, and execute our code, as well as prepare and use ipynb notebooks for course materials

- Please follow the [official installation guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) to install VScode on your machine.

### Conda/mamba (via miniforge)
Conda environments allow you to create isolated environments for different projects, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. Mamba is a faster alternative to the conda package manager. By using the miniforge installer, you will have the option to use both conda or mamba to create and use different environment for your projects.

- Please download and install the miniforge installer for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

### For windows users:
Many (most) bioinformatics tools are built for Unix-like environments (Linux, macOS). For this course, Windows users will need to install and use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run these tools. This is effectively a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows.

- Please follow the [official guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL on your machine.
- For information about how to use WSL with VSCode, please see the documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).
- You will likely have to install the `WSL` extension for VSCode (instructions in previous link).

### Optional (but recommended tools)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): Version control system
-
